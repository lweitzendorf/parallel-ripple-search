From navigation to video games \cite{GMaps}, single source-target pair pathfinding can be found at the heart of many systems. 
As problem sizes increase, it becomes difficult for serial algorithms to achieve acceptable latency. 
Parallel ripple search, as proposed by Bidarra et al. \cite{PRS}, aims to leverage modern multi-core architectures by effectively parallelizing the problem and dividing the search space across threads. 
This report will focus on implementing and benchmarking parallel ripple search to investigate its advantages and disadvantages over other pathfinding algorithms.
